As an IT professional Adam is diverse and a true technical wiz who loves solving problems and making disparate systems work uniformaly. Problem solving, deep technical knowledge base, a strong foundation and Adam's personal commitment to his projects make him a bargain in consideration for employemt. I would highly recommend him for just about any IT related activity as I have seen him rise to the occasion in many times of critical need. If you have the opportuniuty to leverage Adam as a resource consider yourself fortunate and have confidence that what you are attempting will be complete and functional on time and in budget."
